# What is this?

It's a Todo application made using Typescript, React, Redux and Styled-components (and several other tools in development cycle)

### I heard, when a developer creates yet another TODO application, a kitten dies. Are you so bad? (aka Why you did this)

Well, no, it's not true. I made it in my free time for fun :)
**Kittens are safe**

## Ok, how can I run this?

Pull this project to your local machine and run `public/index.html` in a browser, simple as that

## Can I change it for my own needs?

Yep!

Install dependencies

```npm i```

Run webpack in development mode

```npm start```

Open `public/index.html` in browser, than change something and refresh browser.

#### Why didn't you add React Hot Loader so I wouldn't need to refresh browser on every change?

And add another bulk of code to my `node_modules` folder? **NO WAY!**

_Just kidding, I left it to you, so you can excersise in project setup, whatever_
